# Vaccine Passport

> Note: Please use this at your own risk.

An app that toggles between 2 select images. Useful if you want to show your Vaccine Passport on
one of them and a piece of ID on the other. Created because the author didn't want to scroll
through their image gallery on their phone. Which is mainly convenience's sake.
